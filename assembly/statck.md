### function stack
When we call a function, Firstly, its return address pushes to stack, then functionâ€™s parameters pushes to stack from right to left.

After end of function execution, address copied in (RIP) and application continue to executes from next place after function

### stack register
* RBP is the base pointer register. It points to the base of the current stack frame.
* RSP is the stack pointer, which points to the top of current stack frame.

two commands for work with stack:
* push argument - increments stack pointer (RSP) and stores argument in location pointed by stack pointer
* pop argument - copied data to argument from location pointed by stack pointer

```nasm
_start:
    mov rax, 1          ; now assume rbp = rsp
    mov rdx, 2
    push rax            ; [rsp] = 1; [rbp] = 1
    push rdx            ; [rsp] = 2; [rbp - 8] = 2
    mov rax, [rsp + 8]  ; [rsp + 8] = [rbp] = 1
```

### function call
x86_64 linux calling conventions, according to System V AMD64 ABI:
* rdi - first argument
* rsi - second argument
* rdx - third argument
* rcx - fourth argument
* r8 - fifth argument
* r9 - sixth
Next arguments will be passed in stack

int foo(int a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, int a5, int a6, int a7);

* a1 -> rdi
* a2 -> rsi
* a3 -> rdx
* a4 -> rcx
* a5 -> r8
* a6 -> r9
* a7

#### x86_64 calling convention. The way we pass float parameters through registers.
There is special registers: xmm0 - xmm15 provided by sse.
First of all we need to put number of xmmN register to rax register, and put result to xmmN register.
```nasm
mov rax, 0
movq xmm0, [result]
call printResult        ; printResult(double x)
```


### data section
```nasm
section .data   ; initialized data or constants
    num1:   equ 100
    num2:   equ 50
    msg:    db "Sum is correct", 10
section .bss    ; non initialized variables
```
